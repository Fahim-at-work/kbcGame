                            <li>Before a question is asked, the player is allowed to bank the money that corresponds to the level they are at on the “Money Tree”. However, the player should not be allowed to bank money if they are on level $0 on the money
                                tree.

                            <li>If the person has $0 after round 1, they automatically lose the game. BANK -> $100,000</li>
